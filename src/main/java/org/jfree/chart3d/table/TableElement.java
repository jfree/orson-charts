/**
 * An element (typically a single cell) in a table.  This interface defines
 * methods for determining the preferred size of the element, for laying out
 * the element (including sub-elements if there are any), and drawing the
 * element within specified bounds.  Various kinds of table elements will be
 * used to construct interesting tables.

 * It is important that these methods are implemented in a stateless manner. 
 * There is some redundancy in calculation between the layout and drawing 
 * methods in order to preserve the statelessness, but it is important to 
 * ensure that table elements can be rendered to multiple targets
