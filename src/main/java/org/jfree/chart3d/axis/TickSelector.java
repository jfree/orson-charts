 * <p>Provides standard tick sizes and formatting for numerical axes.  
 * Conceptually, the selector maintains a list of standard tick sizes (ordered 
 * by size), and a pointer to the current (selected) tick size.  Clients of
 * the selector will initialise the pointer by calling the 
 * {@link #select(double)} method with a reference value (a guess, based on 
 * context, of the largest usable tick size - for example, one half of the
 * axis length) then, as required, move the pointer to a smaller or larger
 * tick size (using the {@link #next()} and {@link #previous()} methods) to 
 * find the most appropriate standard size to use.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The {@link NumberTickSelector} class provides a standard implementation, 
 * but you can create your own if necessary.</p>
