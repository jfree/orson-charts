<b>Orson Charts</b> is a chart library for the Java(tm) platform that can 
generate a wide variety of 3D charts for use in client-side applications 
(JavaFX and Swing) and server-side applications (with export to SVG, PDF, 
PNG and JPEG formats). Key features include:
<p><ol>
<li>multiple chart types: pie charts, bar charts (regular and 
        stacked), line charts, area charts, scatter plots and surface charts;</li>
<li>a built-in lightweight 3D rendering engine - no additional or complex 
        dependencies, resulting in easy deployment;</li>
<li>mouse-enabled chart viewing components (for both JavaFX and Swing) provide 
    360 degree rotation and zooming for precise end-user view control;</li>
<li>auto-adaptive axis labeling;</li>
<li>easy export of charts to PDF and SVG for reporting;</li>
<li>a clean and well-documented API, with a high degree of chart 
    configurability;</li></ol>

Here are some samples (which may not be visible if your browser does not 
support SVG, in which case you should get a new browser):

<table>
    <tr>
      <td><object id="ABC" data="doc-files/BarChart3DDemo1.svg"  
        type="image/svg+xml" width="500" height="359"> 
         </object>
      </td>
      <td><object id="ABC" data="doc-files/ScatterPlot3DDemo2.svg"  
        type="image/svg+xml" width="500" height="359"> 
        </object>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><object id="ABC" data="doc-files/PieChart3DDemo1.svg"  
        type="image/svg+xml" width="500" height="359"> 
         </object>
      </td>
      <td><object id="ABC" data="doc-files/AreaChart3DDemo1.svg"  
        type="image/svg+xml" width="500" height="359"> 
</object></td></tr>
</table>

Orson Charts includes only 3D charts, for 2D charts we recommend the excellent 
<a href="http://www.jfree.org/" target="JFreeChart">JFreeChart</a> library
(by the same author).
<br><br>
There is also a version of Orson Charts available for the Android platform.

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
To get started with Orson Charts, you simply need to add the 
<code>orsoncharts-1.x.jar</code> file to your classpath and begin coding.  Your 
first step is to set up some data that you want to display.  Orson Charts reads
data through a dataset interface - there are three key interfaces, one that is
used for pie charts (<code>PieDataset3D</code>), one that is used for bar charts
and other category based charts (<code>CategoryDataset3D</code>) and one for 
plots that use numerical data (<code>XYZDataset</code>).  There are standard
implementations of these interfaces includes in the library, making it 
straightforward to create a new dataset. Here is an example for a pie chart:
<br><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;StandardPieDataset3D dataset = new StandardPieDataset3D();<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;dataset.add("Milk Products", 625);<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;dataset.add("Meat", 114);<br></code>
<br><br>
Once your dataset is ready, the next step is to create a chart object - here the 
<code>Chart3DFactory</code> class can help, as it has utility methods to create 
some standard chart types:
<br><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chart3D chart = Chart3DFactory.createPieChart("Title", "Subtitle", dataset);</code>
<br><br>
Finally, if you are developing a Swing application, you will want to place the
chart somewhere in your UI.  Here the <code>Chart3DPanel</code> class can
be used:
<br><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chart3DPanel chartPanel = new Chart3DPanel(chart);</code>
<br><br>
You can find complete examples in the <code>com.orsoncharts.demo</code> package.

pages to learn more about Orson Charts.
